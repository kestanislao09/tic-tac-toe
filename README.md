## Updates

### 3/27/22
*0013* Oh lord, this project was started a week(?) ago... Not including the planning phase.. HTML and CSS was set up, then hooked up most of the main game. Board manipulation has been set up, then the logic for taking turns, then the win conditions, and now the navigation module. Still alot to go, but I've forgotten to commit my changes since I finished the HTML.. ah well.

### 4/15/22
*0416* Both of the gameover modal's buttons have been hooked up and are working properly now.

### 4/17/22
*0020* Back buttons have been hooked up and the player name boxes update with player names.

## Future Goals
